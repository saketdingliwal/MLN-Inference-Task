% EXAMPLE 2
%
% a~b=0.8.
% b~c=0.75.
% p(a,c).
%
% Both A1 and A3 fail to find the answer p(b,b) for the goal p(X,X):
%
% FDES> p(X,X)
% Info: Processing:
%   answer(X) :-
%     p(X,X).
% {
% }
% Info: 0 tuples computed.          
%
% However, A1 succeeds for p(b,b), which is incorrect and thus makes 
% A1 incomplete (in particular for the goal p(X,X), which does not 
% find the solution p(b,b)).
% A3 fails for p(b,b), i.e., p(b,b) is not proximate to p(a,c), which 
% is correct, because this would mean that a is also proximate to c 
% (which is not) because of the equality of both arguments in p
% This is the same to say the following (by linearizing p(X,X)): 
% p(X,Y), X~~Y --> X/a, Y/c, a~~c, which should fail
